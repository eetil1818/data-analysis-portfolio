# Marketplace Performance Dashboard

This project analyses weekly performance across two marketplaces using anonymised, masked sales data.

## Focus
- Weekly revenue trends
- Conversion rate and ROAS efficiency
- Product mix impact (main range vs spare parts)
- SKU-level revenue concentration

## Highlights
- Main range products are used for fair cross-marketplace comparison
- One marketplace shows higher revenue volatility driven by ads and campaigns
- The other demonstrates higher conversion efficiency and more stable demand
- Spare parts provide a consistent baseline revenue where available
- Revenue is concentrated among a small number of top SKUs

## Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
All data has been masked and anonymised for portfolio purposes while preserving realistic business patterns.
